# PortfolioPage
Personal Portfolio Page of Steven Grootaert
<h4> Welcome to my updated portfolio page</h4>
<hr />
<p>
I've updated this site: first by including it as a subdomain of grootaert.com which is my main portfolio page that focuses on my architectural work. 
That page is made using Square Space which is a great service based out of New York City. After much trial and error I was able to sort out the required procedures for creating a secure HTTPS site hosted by Github Pages using custom domain settings in which 
my subdomain is redirected with a CNAME record in the root of my repository. For a time I had a github hosted page called 'test-signal' which I used to ensure that the DNS records were functioning properly 
and used it as a placeholder until I could get a better working version of this page up and running.

Subsequently this page is a more integrated (and functional) version of the portfolio page I made earlier as part of a course requirement for my coding bootcamp at Eleven Fifty (1150). 
After some time away from 1150 I had to refresh my front-end skills in HTML, CSS, and git to build this site. I've also used Bootstrap 5 (currently v5.1.3) to help style the site. 
I did this because I could hardly call myself an emerging programmer and not scratch/kitbash my own portfolio page. It didn't seem right to just make another Square Space page that contained the relevant information. 
I have learned so much in this process and I know much better that I know so little. My current focus is more on the back-end with the inner workings of software development and data structures presenting more interesting problems to solve - 
That said, I'm not going to dive too deeply into making this site a showcase for my web development skills. As a designer I have a high personal bar for design aesthetic and UX/UI functionality; 
My current skill set doesn't support my vision so I've opted to showcase the skills I do have and - better to do it a little messy than not do it at all.
